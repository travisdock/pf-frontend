Things to do:
- [ ]Add extra calculations to a dashboard-like page
- [ ]<del>-Table filterable by month (instead of just date)</del> _decided not to do this because you can simply type in the year and month in the search bar and it will filter. If I wanted to make it look better or more obvious I could add a dropdown for month and day but that seems overcomplicated_
- [ ]Sorting table by income and expense (Currently table is only expenses)
- [ ]Edit entry
- [ ]Edit Category
- [ ]Untracked categories
- [ ]Delete category (asks to recategorize or delete existing entries)
- [ ]Add "are you sure?" to delete buttons
- [ ]Forward backward buttons/scrolling for charts
- [ ]Percent of income saved, spent, donated?
- [ ]Sum by filtered table results
- [ ]Recurring payments
- [ ]Savings and goals
