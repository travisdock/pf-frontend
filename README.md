## Description
This is a learning and working project, by which I mean I actually use it and I also use it to learn. I built it to track my personal finances and I use it as such, but I also use it whenever I want to learn something.  When I wanted to learn RSpec I added it to the backend. When I started I wanted to learn Redux so I used it here. I am constantly tweaking it and I hope to continue that for years to come as my knowledge and experience evolve.
The front end is a React PWA hosted on Firebase.  The back end is a Rails API hosted on Heroku.
