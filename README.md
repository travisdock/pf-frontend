## Description
This is a learning and working project, by which I mean I actually use it and I also use it to learn. I built it to track my personal finances and I use it as such, but I also use it whenever I want to learn something.  When I wanted to learn RSpec I added it to the backend. When I started I wanted to learn Redux so I used it here. I am constantly tweaking it and I hope to continue that for years to come as my knowledge and experience evolve.
The front end is a React PWA hosted on Firebase.  The back end is a Rails API hosted on Heroku.

## Research Resources for Accessibility that I need to look at
##### Inclusive Design | Microsoft https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/
- Inclusive Design is a methodology, born out of digital environments, that enables and draws on the full range of human diversity. Most importantly, this means including and learning from people with a range of perspectives.
##### Mismatch | Kat Holmes https://mismatch.design/
- Although inclusive design is a rising topic of interest in business, many leaders don't know where to begin. Mismatch.design is about growing a global community of inclusive design practitioners. We connect and learn through shared stories and resources. We believe inclusion is more than a nice idea. It's an economic imperative and a repeatable practice.
##### Inclusive Components | Heydon Pickering https://inclusive-components.design/
- A blog trying to be a pattern library. All about designing inclusive web interfaces, piece by piece.
##### aXe: The Accessibility Engine | Deque https://www.deque.com/axe/
- Axe is an open source rules library for accessibility testing. It was developed to empower developers to take automated accessibility testing into their own hands and to avoid common pitfalls of other automated accessibility tools.
##### Tenon: Simplify Your Accessibility | Karl Groves, Tenon https://tenon.io/
- Tenon.io exists because universal design is hard. We create software to help you reach beyond compliance and build superior experiences for everyone.
##### Web Accessibility: Developing with Empathy | Udacity https://www.udacity.com/course/web-accessibility--ud891
- In this course you’ll get hands-on experience making web applications accessible. You’ll understand when and why users need accessibility. Then you’ll dive into the "how": making a page work properly with screen readers, and managing input focus (e.g., the highlight you see when tabbing through a form). You’ll understand what "semantics" and "semantic markup" mean for web pages and add ARIA markup to enable navigating the interface with a range of assistive devices. Finally, you’ll learn styling techniques that help users with partial vision navigate your pages easily and reliably.
##### Our Bold Call to Action: #CSforALL Must Include Students With Disabilities—and it Needs to Happen Now | via Medium https://medium.com/csforall-stories/our-bold-call-to-action-csforall-must-include-students-with-disabilities-and-it-needs-to-happen-fc2224cd902
- A born-accessible Computer Science for All means thinking about women and minorities, but also about screen readers, closed captioning, remapping keys, magnification, Alt descriptions, WCAG, and other important ideas.
##### Teach Access http://teachaccess.org/
- Technology companies dedicated to accessibility have faced the common challenge of preparing designers, engineers and researchers to think and build inclusively. Similarly, academic programs in design, engineering and HCI are seeking ways to better prepare students to address the needs of diverse populations. Given this shared challenge, industry, academia and advocacy have now come together to create models for teaching and training students of technology to create accessible experiences.
